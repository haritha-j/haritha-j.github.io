 Trying (semi-succesfully) to get computers to do what I want.

 3<sup>rd</sup> year PhD student at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), working on 3D modelling of infrastructure.
 My research interests are in 3D computer vision and infrastructure modelling. These days, I'm also fascinated by AI safety.
 
 I graduated with my bachelor's degree from the University of Moratuwa in 2021 specializing in Computer Science and Engineering. I completed my Master of research degree from the Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge in 2022. My academic profile is available [here.](https://www.construction.cam.ac.uk/staff/haritha-jayasinghe)
