 Trying (semi-succesfully) to get computers to do what I want. 

 2nd year PhD student at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), working on digitization of industrial facilities. 
 My research interests are in 3D computer vision and infrastructure digitisation. These days, I'm also fascinated by AI safety.
 
 I graduated with my bachelor's degree from the University of Moratuwa in 2021 specializing in Computer Science and Engineering. I completed my Master of research degree from the Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge.
